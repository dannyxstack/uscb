          <p class="mt-3">It is compulsory for you to finalise your enrolment by registering at Penfold before commencing your course. To register you must bring your passport and CoE letter. If you wish to have credit transferred from previous studies, you also need to bring your original documents to be sighted and photocopied for our records.</p>
          <p class="">Also, please note that, if you have not enrolled in your course within 14 days of the commencement date indicated on your CoE, Penfold is required, by law, to cancel your CoE.</p>
          <p>Please note that you are required to complete your address and emergency contact details and to inform Penfold of any changes, as it is a condition of your study visa. Failure to do so is a breach of one of the conditions of your student visa and can result in your visa’s cancellation.</p>
